This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in React applications involving the asynchronous nature of state updates with the `useState` hook.  The example showcases how attempting to immediately access the updated state after calling `setSearchQuery` can lead to incorrect values being logged to the console and potentially inconsistencies in the UI. The solution shows how to address this using functional updates or by leveraging the updated state within the subsequent render cycle. This is particularly relevant for developers working with React's state management mechanisms and is a good illustration of how asynchronous operations can lead to unintended behavior if not handled correctly.
